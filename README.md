# I get it.

You're a developer and you're probably constantly worried about **appearances**. About your portfolio, making yourself look good for current and future employers. You very well might be here visiting my profile in hopes of finding something to help you with that.

But **Open Source** is about contributing to the _greater whole of code_, not about your own personal gain. So while you're here, I challenge you to put all that aside for just a moment and try to find something different: [something that makes you laugh](https://github.com/benjaminbhollon/umify), [a neat display](https://gist.github.com/benjaminbhollon/c7db2ee6f7fb4087f5c79b2912873ce0), or [something to help you learn a new skill](https://github.com/benjaminbhollon/learn-clef).

Then get back to work and make something great. I bet you'll do awesome.
