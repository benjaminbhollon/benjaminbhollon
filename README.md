# I'm Benjamin Hollon.

Human Being, Avid Reader, Writer, Trombonist, Composer, Actor, Christian, Avocado Advocate, and Part-Time Polymath.

## I do a lot of things.

From music to code to writing, my skillset and hobby-list is diverse and extensive. No matter how much I try, I can almost never keep every profile updated with timely and accurate information. To be sure you're getting the latest from me, be sure to [check out my website](https://seewitheyesclosed.com/) and consider [subscribing to my weekly digest](https://digest.seewitheyesclosed.com/).

That being said, Github is a _great_ place to see my various coding projects (check my [Codepen](https://codepen.io/bibliobone) for small HTML/CSS/JS demos), so without further ado here's a quick rundown of what I'm up to in the cyber realm:

## My Best Work

- **[See With Eyes Closed](https://github.com/benjaminbhollon/see-with-eyes-closed)** - I coded my website and blog completely from scratch using ExpressJS, Pug, and MongoDB. Here's the full source code. Feel free to drop by the repository and leave a few tips, they'll be greatly appreciated. [Here's the live site.](https://seewitheyesclosed.com/)
- **[Habitica Chat Extension](https://github.com/HabitRPG/habitica-chat-extension)** - I reworked the super-outdated code of the Habitica Chat Extension and made it usable again, including porting it to Firefox. This was a several-month project.
- **[AvoJS](https://avo.js.org/)** - An extremely lightweight (<400 bytes!!!) Javascript framework that lets you add a callback to variable assignments. Check it out, it's more powerful than it sounds and is extremely simple to get the hang of.
- I'm in the progress of moving my projects over to open source, so more should appear here eventually.

## Current Projects

- **[Serial Microfiction](https://github.com/benjaminbhollon/serial-microfiction)** - I'm working on a writing project where I'll release a new update to the story every day. Here's the code I'm planning to run it on.
- **Machine Learning** - I haven't published anything on this yet, but it's a field I'm very excited about. I'm focusing on Natural Language Processing.

## I Specialize In...

- **Web Development** - I've worked in HTML/CSS, PHP, Javascript, Jquery, NodeJS with Express, Pug, SQL, and MongoDB. If you have a website idea and need someone to make it happen, let me know. Not promising anything, but if I think it's a good cause I might help out for free. Or I'm just available to offer tips.
- **Using APIs** - I've done extensive work in the notoriously under-documented Habitica API, which has well equipped me for work in other ones. if you're looking to integrate two services, I'm your man.
- **Code in Other Contexts** - Sicne the beginning, I've been using code to lighten my workload. If you've got tedious tasks that need automation, I might be able to help you out. (There's even a possibility I've already coded something for what you need and never released it publicly.)

## How to Reach Me

For my privacy and sanity's sake, I ask that people contact me first through [my contact form on my website](https://seewitheyesclosed.com/contact/), after which I'll follow up if you're not spamming me.

That being said it's not honestly too hard to find my email address. Please don't go looking for it. I really do prefer a message through the above; a direct email might just get flagged as spam.

I really am happy to receive messages though. You can also mention me on Twitter [@bibliobone](https://twitter.com/bibliobone) if you prefer that to email. Just know I only check it every couple days.
